## ecaaf(Edge Computing as a Function) (incubating)


ecaaf is an open source event driven functional programming service for edge computing. It introduces an event driven programming paradigm for the edge. A big motivation of ECAAF is to provide a collaborative platform for the IoT ecosystem. ecaaf achieves this via the ecaaf-catalog. The catalog acts as a funclet store to which organizations and developer community contribute. Such a rich colloboration would eventually allow to create a fabric across the IoT stack(Edge, Fog and Cloud).
