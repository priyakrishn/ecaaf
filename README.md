## Goongru (incubating)

Goongru is an open source event driven functional programming service for edge computing. It introduces an event driven programming paradigm for the edge or edge computing as a function (ecaaf). A big motivation of Goongru is to provide a collaborative platform for the IoT ecosystem. Goongru achieves this via the catalog, the catalog acts as a funclet store for organizations and developer community can contribute. Such a rich colloboration would eventually facilitate the creation of a unified fabric across the IoT stack(Edge, Fog and Cloud).
